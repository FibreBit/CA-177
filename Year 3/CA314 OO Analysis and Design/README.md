#Project Overview
The goal of the assignment is to implement an Internet-based, strategy game, called MyScrabble, which is closely modelled after the board game Scrabble. The game is Internet-based; that is, players will be able to play each other and possibly the machine from remote. This application will, therefore, take on a client/server structure, where each client supports one player’s view of the game while the server coordinates communication between players and orchestrates the sequence of events of the game. 
The game description and background is here:

The goal is to produce a game that is exciting and likely to hold players’ interest. It is expected that teams will come up with their own variations of rules and moves in order to achieve this. For example, one might consider having an option of playing/learning against the computer.
