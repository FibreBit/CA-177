This was the first of our programming assignments for CA304. Our task was to create an IP calculator
capable of displaying the attributtes of a given IP address. Some of these attributes include:
```
The class of the address
The number of networks for the class of the address
The number of hosts for the class of the address
The first IP address for the class
